# CI/CD

After some, i.e. a lot, of struggle I got the CI/CD running with a Github Action. The problems summarize with

- My provider has a geoblocking: No FTP from the Github Actions server
- No SSH activated
- No SSH-Key provided

So the only way to do it is over [scp](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1) and the most popular scp-action does some ssh stuff (unpack a tar). I finally found a action that allows me to do this all [Copy via ssh](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/copy-via-ssh).

So the steps of the action are

- Build the Jekyll site
- Deploy it via scp

Now that everything is working, I can start writing some more data related things.

## Code

For those who are interested into Github-Actions below you have the description

```yaml
name: Jekyll site CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Build the site in the jekyll/builder container
      run: |
        docker run \
        -v ${{ github.workspace }}:/srv/jekyll -v ${{ github.workspace }}/_site:/srv/jekyll/_site \
        jekyll/builder:latest /bin/bash -c "chmod a+w /srv/jekyll/Gemfile.lock && chmod 777 /srv/jekyll && jekyll build --future"
    - name: Sync files
      uses: garygrossgarten/github-action-scp@release
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
        local: ${{ github.workspace }}/_site/
        remote: /
